# School-Stuff
Just a repo to store school assignments, as I distro hop A LOT. 

This is just for COP1000, from Daytona State College. It is the first computer science class in Python. Please do your own homework.
Feel free to look through the code though ifyou need any help. 

Our professor doesn't write the best code, and I understand this code didn't always follow convention but this is how she mandates we write our code.
So even if it looks bad to you, trust me this is how she wants it. She's given me points off for grammar too, so if make sure there aren't any typos and stuff when you turn in yours.
